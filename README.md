# JavaScript Book Library #

[Live Demo](https://pataskad.github.io/book-js-library/)

The 'JavaScript Library' is a project where the goal is to manage a library of books through the use of constructors, objects, and prototypes to allow for greater efficiency and performance in order to be able to scale this approach up to a professional level working with professional, business level applications.  This project will allow a user to browse through their current repository of books and add or remove books as desired.  Additionally, they will also be able to toggle the read status of each book on each created book 'card'.

# Learning Outcomes #

The goal of this project is to further extend my working knowledge and understanding of objects, prototypes, and how they come together to create more efficient solutions to JavaScript based applications.  The primary technical goal of this project is to further my understanding of JavaScript objects and specifically object constructors while also making use of object prototypes for maximum performance to reduce excess processes as much as possible in order to avoid technical debt.

# Based on 'The Odin Project' Curriculum #

This project has been outlined by The Odin Project course curriculum with the extent of help being given being a rough idea of what order and steps to take to create this project. Other than that, this project is entirely put together based upon my own research and skills built up over the course of my studies the last couple months.

# Running this Project Locally #

My preferred and recommended method to running this project is via the VSCode 'live server' extension.  This extension will provide you with an efficient method to not only view the project in a live environment, but also provide an excellent opportunity to view changes made to the codebase nearly instantly.
